SELECT MONTHNAME(charged_datetime) as month, sum(amount) as revenue FROM billing

-- 2) What query would you run to get total rev collected from client with id = 2?

-- 8) What query would you run to get list of client names & total # of leads generated for each clients' sites between 1-1-11 to 12-31-11? Order this query by client id. Come up with a second query that shows all the  clients, site names, & total # of leads generated from each site for all time

-- 9) Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client for each month of the year. Order is by client id
SELECT concat(clients.first_name, "", clients.last_name) as clients, sum(billing.amount) as revenue, MONTHNAME(billing.charged_datetime) as month, YEAR(billing.charged_datetime) as year FROM clients
JOIN billing ON clients.client_id = billing.client_id
GROUP BY billing.client_id, MONTHNAME(billing.charged_datetime), YEAR(billing.charged_datetime)
ORDER BY clients.client_id, DATE(billing.charged_datetime);

-- 10) Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. Group the results so that each row shows a new client. It will become clearer when you add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)
SELECT concat(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) as client, group_concat(' ', sites.domain_name separator '/') as sites FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
GROUP BY sites.client_id
ORDER BY clients.client_id;
